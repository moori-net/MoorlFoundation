## Free Shopware 6 CMS Elements

### Shopping list / Quick buy

With this element you can add a selection of products directly to the shopping cart. This is an ideal and simple alternative to product bundles.

You can set here whether you want to place the products individually and/or all of them in the shopping basket. A variant switch is also possible.

This element is also used by other plug-ins, such as [Shop-The-Look](../MoorlShopTheLook/index.md) or the [Magazine Add-On](../MoorlMagazine/index.md) for [Public Profiles](../MoorlCreator/index.md).

### Download List

In general, downloads are always useful, e.g. information material on products or a small download area for CMS pages.

Use the CMS element and assign the downloads from the Shopware Media Manager.

This element is also used by other plugins, such as the [Magazine Add-On](../MoorlMagazine/index.md) for [Public Profiles](../MoorlCreator/index.md).

### Social Share

This CMS element can be placed on any CMS page, it provides share buttons for Twitter and Facebook.

### Table of contents

The table of contents has been specially developed for the plugins [Magazine Add-On](../MoorlMagazine/index.md) and [Public Profiles](../MoorlCreator/index.md).

It builds a dynamic navigation for the content area by assigning ID attributes to the HTML tags h2, h3, h4 and h5.

### HTML tag

Here you can create a single HTML tag element, e.g. for headings.

### Accordion

This element was taken from the Appflix Foundation Plugin, it offers the possibility to structure text contents. Get suitable for building FAQ sections!
