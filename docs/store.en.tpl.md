## About the Extension

This plugin forms the foundation for numerous extensions. It includes animations, **Font Awesome 5 Free** with more than 1,500 icons, as well as recurring functions and translations.

## Usage of Foundation

Unless otherwise specified, **moori Foundation** is used in the following plugins:

* Plugins by [Appflix](https://store.shopware.com/de/extension-partners/appflix-ug)
* Plugins by [moori](https://store.shopware.com/de/extension-partners/moori)

## Purpose of Foundation

The portfolio of Appflix and moori now includes more than 100 plugins for Shopware 6.  
Naturally, this leads to a wide variety of challenges at many different levels.

To keep plugins lightweight and extend the Shopware Core in a meaningful way, many core functionalities have been bundled into Foundation.

**Examples of included features:**

- *FontAwesome SVG:* Provides additional icons for designing your storefront pages
- *Animate CSS:* Enables animations in the storefront
- *OpenStreetMap and Map Markers:* Forms the basis for Store Locator, DeliveryWare (Appflix), and Classifieds (Appflix)
- *Listings, Sliders, and Sorting:* Used by all plugins that manage their own entities
- *Automatic Translations:* With the help of DeepL, all language-related content can be translated
- *Demo Assistant:* Create and import demo content in JSON format (also used in RH Webdesign themes)
- *CMS Tools:* A comprehensive collection of useful utilities
- *CMS Elements:* All CMS elements relevant for various plugins are combined in Foundation
- and much more …

You may also use Foundation as the basis for your own plugins or projects.  
However, extracting individual features or tools for your own purposes is strictly prohibited.

## Premium Features

Some functions can be unlocked through a paid upgrade.  
This particularly applies to the CMS Tools and the translation feature via DeepL.

## Free Features

The free features are primarily intended to keep the Appflix and moori plugins lightweight.  
Of course, they can also be freely used for other purposes.

## Settings

### OpenStreetMap

Since some Appflix and moori plugins rely on OpenStreetMap, this technology has been directly integrated into Foundation.  
As an alternative to Google Maps, OpenStreetMap offers many advantages without sacrificing functionality.

A CMS element for displaying maps is available for free use. Additional options are provided by specific plugins in the portfolio.

- *Tile Layer URL:* You can use the default URL or your personal Mapbox URL. This allows you to style the tiles according to your needs. [Examples can be found here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).
- *Copyright:* A copyright notice must always be displayed. The format depends on the tile provider.
- *Additional Settings:* Specify how the map should behave during user interactions.
- *Country Restriction:* Limit geo-coordinate searches to specific countries.
- *Units:* Distances can be displayed in either miles or kilometers.

### Map Marker

You can mark your locations with individual markers.  
Use the **Demo Assistant** to load predefined markers.

- The configuration can be found under *Settings → Extensions → moori Map Marker*.

You can use your own SVGs as HTML or upload graphics. Each marker graphic consists of three layers: Marker, Retina, and Shadow.

The [official Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/) provides further guidance.

Once your marker has been fully configured, you will receive instant feedback in the preview.
